# GithubTracker

## Software development teams can reduce their efficiency in the project by applying this issue tracking system in a disorganized way. It is not known how to use this platform in the most appropriate and efficient way. In addition, the fact that dispersed issue tracking system data cannot be easily accessed, brought together and regularity cannot be achieved by the researchers.

## There is no information on how to use the issue-tracking systems on the platforms correctly and efficiently. In addition, this system also does not have any standard. For this reason, it is necessary to determine what people should pay attention to on this platform and what they should use for what. In order to eliminate this deficiency, it is aimed to create a certain standard by analyzing the platform, determining the best practices related to the use of this system.

## As a result of this project, we create a profile as the best practices in using issue-tracking, according to the issue-related metrics we have determined. We plan to create a guide by looking at these profiles on how smaller companies,learners or companies which are use the issue system inefficiently. With looking these profiles they can act more efficient.
