Software development teams can reduce their efficiency in the project by applying thisissue tracking system in a disorganized way. It is not known how to use this platform inthe most appropriate and efficient way.  In addition, the fact that dispersed issue trackingsystem data cannot be easily accessed, brought together and regularity cannot be achievedby the researchers.There  is  no  information  on  how  to  use  the  issue-tracking  systems  on  the  platformscorrectly and efficiently.  In addition, this system also does not have any standard.  Forthis  reason,  it  is  necessary  to  determine  what  people  should  pay  attention  to  on  thisplatform  and  what  they  should  use  for  what.   In  order  to  eliminate  this  deficiency,  itis  aimed  to  create  a  certain  standard  by  analyzing  the  platform,  determining  the  bestpractices related to the use of this system.As  a  result  of  this  project,  we  create  a  profile  as  the  best  practices  in  using  issue-tracking, according to the issue-related metrics we have determined.  We plan to create aguide by looking at these profiles on how smaller companies,learners or companies whichare  use  the  issue  system  inefficiently.   With  looking  these  profiles  they  can  act  more efficient.
